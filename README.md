# Where Am I - Adaptive Montel Carlo Localization

[![Udacity - Robotics NanoDegree Program](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Extra+Images/RoboND_flag.png)](https://www.udacity.com/robotics)

In this project, you will learn to utilize ROS packages to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a provided map in the Gazebo and RViz simulation environments.

## Tasks
Over the course of the project, as part of the Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree, you will learn about several aspects of robotics with a focus on ROS, including -

- Building a mobile robot for simulated tasks.

- Creating a ROS package that launches a custom r-obot model in a Gazebo world and utilizes packages like AMCL and the Navigation Stack.

- Exploring, adding, and tuning specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible localization results.
